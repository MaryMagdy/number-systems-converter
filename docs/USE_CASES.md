# User Stories

1. As a student, I want to enter `13` as decimal and see `1101` and `D`, so I can learn how the bases map.
2. As a student, I want to view the step-by-step division used to convert decimal→binary, so I understand the algorithm.
3. As an instructor, I want a comparison table of 1..20, so I can show examples in class.
4. As a student, I want a visualizer showing ON/OFF bits, so I can connect binary bits to their weights.
5. As a user, I want to toggle Dark/Light theme so that the UI is comfortable to read.
